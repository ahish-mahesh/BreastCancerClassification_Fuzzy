# A Knowledge-Based System for Breast Cancer Classification Using Fuzzy Logic Method

## Datasets overview:
Two datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository have been used in the implementation of this research paper.
• Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) dataset. It contains 569 instances. There are 32 attributes - https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic)
• Mammographic mass (Elter et al., 2007) dataset. It contains 961 instances. And has 6 attributes - https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Mammographic+Mass

## Process:
This paper has been selected to try out the actual real-life implementation of the algorithms learnt. Different algorithms are applied in different steps to the given datasets in an attempt to improve the prediction accuracy of breast cancer. This proposed knowledge-based system can be used as a clinical decision support system to assist medical practitioners in the health practice.
Various steps like clustering, noise removal and classification techniques are involved in the process to get the increased accuracy. They are,
• Expectation Maximization (EM) is used as a clustering method to cluster the data in similar groups.
• Classification and Regression Trees (CART) are used to generate the fuzzy rules to be used for the classification of breast cancer disease in the knowledge-based system of fuzzy rule-based reasoning method.
• To overcome the multi-collinearity issue, we incorporate Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in the proposed knowledge-based system.
